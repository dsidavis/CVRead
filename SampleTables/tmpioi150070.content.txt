IMPORTANCEClostridium difficileis a major cause of health care–associated infection, but
disagreement between diagnostic tests is an ongoing barrier to clinical decision making and
public health reporting. Molecular tests are increasingly used to diagnoseC difficileinfection
(CDI), but many molecular test-positive patients lack toxins that historically defined disease,
making it unclear if they need treatment.
OBJECTIVETo determine the natural history and need for treatment of patients who are toxin
immunoassay negative and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive (Tox−/PCR+) for CDI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSProspective observational cohort study at a single
academic medical center among 1416 hospitalized adults tested forC difficiletoxins 72 hours
or longer after admission between December 1, 2010, and October 20, 2012. The analysis was
conducted in stages with revisions from April 27, 2013, to January 13, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPatients undergoingC difficiletesting were grouped by US
Food and Drug Administration–approved toxin and PCR tests as Tox+/PCR+, Tox−/PCR+, or
Tox−/PCR−. Toxin results were reported clinically. Polymerase chain reaction results were not
reported. The main study outcomes were duration of diarrhea during up to 14 days of
treatment, rate of CDI-related complications (ie, colectomy, megacolon, or intensive care unit
care) and CDI-related death within 30 days.
RESULTSTwenty-one percent (293 of 1416) of hospitalized adults tested forC difficilewere
positive by PCR, but 44.7% (131 of 293) had toxins detected by the clinical toxin test. At
baseline, Tox−/PCR+ patients had lowerC difficilebacterial load and less antibiotic exposure,
fecal inflammation, and diarrhea than Tox+/PCR+ patients (P< .001 for all). The median
duration of diarrhea was shorter in Tox−/PCR+ patients (2 days; interquartile range, 1-4 days)
than in Tox+/PCR+ patients (3 days; interquartile range, 1-6 days) (P= .003) and was similar
to that in Tox−/PCR− patients (2 days; interquartile range, 1-3 days), despite minimal empirical
treatment of Tox−/PCR+ patients. No CDI-related complications occurred in Tox−/PCR+
patients vs 10 complications in Tox+/PCR+ patients (0% vs 7.6%,P< .001). One Tox−/PCR+
patient had recurrent CDI as a contributing factor to death within 30 days vs 11 CDI-related
deaths in Tox+/PCR+ patients (0.6% vs 8.4%,P= .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEAmong hospitalized adults with suspected CDI, virtually all
CDI-related complications and deaths occurred in patients with positive toxin immunoassay
test results. Patients with a positive molecular test result and a negative toxin immunoassay
test result had outcomes that were comparable to patients withoutC difficileby either
method. Exclusive reliance on molecular tests for CDI diagnosis without tests for toxins or
host response is likely to result in overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased health care
costs.

C
lostridium difficileis one of the most common causes
of health care–associated infection in US hospitals,
affecting almost 1% of hospitalized patients each
year.1-3Since 2000, the incidence ofC difficileinfection
(CDI) has increased more than 200% while the rates of other
health care–associated infections have decreased.1,2,4-6
More than 300 000 hospitalizations involve a CDI each
year, at an annual cost of $1.0 to $4.9 billion to the US health
care system.2,7
Initial increases in the rate of CDI were attributed to the
emergence of a novel, hypervirulent strain during a period
when at least 95% of hospitals used toxin immunoassays for
diagnosis (2000-2008).3,5,8-10More recent increases have
been linked to greaterC difficiledetection after the intro-
duction of molecular tests, which are more sensitive and
detect microbial DNA instead of toxin.10-15Individual hospi-
tals have reported a 50% to 100% increase in the rate of CDI
after switching from toxin tests to molecular tests.11,12,14
Similar increases have been observed in the rate of publicly
reported CDI as reporting facilities adopted molecular
tests.15
For decades, toxin tests were favored over culture for
diagnosis of CDI because toxins mediate disease and toxin
detection was faster and provided evidence of toxin produc-
tion in vivo that typically correlated better with clinical
disease.3,10,16-18Molecular tests such as polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) target toxin genes but are similar to culture
in detectingC difficilebacteria regardless of toxin produc-
tion, making it unclear whether positive PCR results reflect
clinical disease.3,10,19-21The uncertain clinical significance
of positive PCR results is problematic in inpatient health
care facilities, whereC difficilecolonization is 5 to 10 times
more common than CDI and noninfectious causes of
diarrhea are also common.22-26Nonetheless, concern that
patients with CDI were being missed by toxin tests
prompted many laboratories to switch to molecular tests
in 2009, when they became available.10,19,27As of the
first quarter of 2014, a total of 44% of acute care hospitals
participating in the National Healthcare Safety Network
(NHSN) reported using molecular tests alone or in combina-
tion with other tests for diagnosis of CDI (NHSN, written
communication, September 15, 2014). Therefore, there is
an urgent need to determine whether patients with negative
toxin test results and positive molecular test results have
CDI or are simply colonized with another cause of
symptoms.
To address this need, we prospectively tested hospital-
ized adults with suspected CDI at the University of Califor-
nia Davis Medical Center with molecular tests while main-
taining our existing toxin test for clinical diagnosis. We then
collected clinical outcome and treatment data to enable us
to ask 3 related questions. First, what is the natural history
of PCR-positive patients with negative toxin immunoassay
results? Second, how do outcomes in these patients com-
pare with outcomes in patients with positive toxin and PCR
results or completely negativeC difficiletest results? Third,
do PCR-positive patients with negative toxin results require
treatment for CDI?
Methods
Study Design and Population
Hospitalized adults with a diarrheal stool sample submitted
forC difficiletesting 72 hours or longer after admission to the
UniversityofCaliforniaDavisMedicalCenterbetweenDecem-
ber 1, 2010, and October 20, 2012, were included in the study.
Only the first sample was analyzed for each patient. Samples
received after discharge were excluded. Patients withC diffi-
ciledetected by culture and no other test were excluded from
the study. The study protocol was approved by the University
ofCaliforniaDavisInstitutionalReviewBoard.Informedcon-
sent was waived for the initial screening and symptom veri-
fication and overall outcome and safety analysis. A subset of
patients had written informed consent obtained for addi-
tional in-person follow-up.
Laboratory Testing
All stool samples had a US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)–approvedC difficiletoxin immunoassay (C difficile
Premier toxins A and B; Meridian Biosciences) performed
and reported clinically. Formed stools were rejected. Eligible
samples also had 1 or more FDA-approved molecularCdiffi-
ciletests (XpertC. difficile/Epi; Cepheid; and illumigeneC.
difficile; Meridian Biosciences) performed but not reported,
allowing patients to be grouped byC difficiletoxin immuno-
assay and PCR results as toxin immunoassay positive and
PCR positive (Tox+/PCR+), Tox−/PCR+, or Tox−/PCR−. Addi-
tional tests were performed to characterize the nature of the
C difficilecolonization and host inflammatory response. The
PCR-positive samples had toxin quantitated (xCELLigence
System for Real-Time Cellular Analysis, version 2; ACEA
Biosciences) and the concentration ofC difficileDNA deter-
mined as a measure of bacterial load (XpertC. difficile/Epi;
Cepheid).28-30The Tox−/PCR+ samples were tested by a cell
cytotoxin assay (C. difficileTox-B; TechLab), the more sensi-
tive historical standard forC difficiletoxin detection and
diagnosis, to determine the number of samples that would
have been positive if this test had been used instead of the
toxin immunoassay. Culture was performed to recoverC dif-
ficileisolates for ribotyping and verification of capacity to
produce toxins. Lactoferrin was measured in PCR+ samples
and random PCR− samples as a marker of inflammation
(Leuko EZ Vue; TechLab; and IBD-Scan; TechLab). Lactofer-
rin results were classified as high if they exceeded the 95th
percentile of results in PCR− patients. See the eMethods in
theSupplementfor additional details.
Clinical Data Collection
Diarrheal symptoms were verified at the time ofC difficile
testing. Patients were considered to have diarrhea if they had
at least 3 unformed bowel movements or at least 600 mL of
rectal or colostomy output recorded in the electronic health
record (EHR) within 24 hours on the day of or before sample
collection. Patients not meeting the threshold for diarrhea in
the EHR had their nurse called to verify diarrheal status.
Other data were obtained from laboratory, EHR, and adminis-

Outcomes and Clinical Case Attribution
The primary outcome was duration of diarrhea for the 15-day
period encompassing the day of sample collection (day 1) and
upto14daysoftreatment.Secondaryoutcomesincludedrate
ofCDI-relatedcomplications(ie,megacolon,colectomyforful-
minantcolitis,andintensivecareunit[ICU]carerelatedtoCDI)
and CDI-related deaths within 30 days. The CDI-related com-
plications and deaths were analyzed separately to distin-
guishpatientswithcomplicatedCDIdiseaseofthecolonfrom
patientswithCDIasacontributingcauseofdeathbutnotnec-
essarily complicated CDI of the colon. RepeatC difficiletests
and treatment were analyzed within 14 days of day 1 as an in-
dication of ongoing clinical suspicion or empirical treatment
forCDIinTox−/PCR+patientsandtodeterminehowmanybe-
camepositivewithrepeattesting.Clostridiumdifficiletestsand
treatment 15 to 30 days after day 1 were analyzed as a proxy
forrecurrentorprolongedCDIoccurringaftertheinitialtreat-
ment period. Ten or more days of metronidazole or oral van-
comycin therapy was considered full treatment. Duration of
diarrheawasdeterminedfromnurse-recordedstoolcountsand
rectal or colostomy outputs in the EHR, excluding formed
stools. Each day was categorized as a diarrhea day if at least 3
unformed stools or at least 600 mL of fecal output was re-
corded. Days with less stool output were categorized as a no-
diarrhea day. Duration of diarrhea was the sum of days from
day 1 to the last day with diarrhea, followed by 2 or more days
without diarrhea. Cases of CDI-related megacolon and colec-
tomies were identified by searching for patients with a proce-
dureorbillingcodeforabdominalradiology,colonoscopy,col-
ectomy, or diagnosis of megacolon or pseudomembranous
colitiswithin30days(eTable1intheSupplement).Clinicaland
surgical notes and radiology, endoscopy, and pathology re-
ports were reviewed to confirm or exclude CDI-related mega-
colon or colectomy. Partially treated complications diag-
nosed before day 1 were excluded. Intensive care unit care
related to CDI was determined as follows. First, patients lo-
catedinortransferredintotheICUonday1(±1day)wereiden-
tified.TheICUcarewasthendeterminedtobeCDIrelated(ie,

EHR review by 2 board-certified infectious diseases physi-
cians (H.H.N., L.W.L., J.V.S., or S.H.C.). The physician adjudi-
cators were blinded to PCR results but otherwise were pro-
vided with all relevant clinical, procedural, diagnostic, and
outcomeinformationavailableintheEHR.Disagreementswere
resolved by a third infectious diseases physician (H.H.N.,
L.W.L., J.V.S., or S.H.C.). Deaths were identified by discharge
dispositioncodesandEHRreviewofPCR-positivepatientswith
unknown mortality status at 30 days. Attribution of deaths as
CDI related or unrelated was determined by blinded infec-
tious diseases physician EHR review (L.W.L., J.V.S., or S.H.C.)
in the same manner as for ICU care.

Results
Patient Cohort and Baseline Characteristics
An overview of the study design, patient cohort, and fol-

were analyzed, including 131 Tox+/PCR+ patients (9.3%), 162
Tox−/PCR+ patients (11.4%), and 1123 Tox−/PCR− patients
(79.3%).

In the multivariable model, Tox+/PCR+ status had the
strongest effect on duration of diarrhea, decreasing the prob-
ability of diarrhea being resolved by 37% each day relative to
the Tox−/PCR− reference group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI,

CDI-Related Complications and Mortality Within 30 Days
ThefrequencyofCDI-relatedcomplications(ie,megacolon,col-
ectomy for fulminant colitis, and ICU care related to CDI) and
deaths is summarized inTable 3. The Tox+/PCR+ patients had
more CDI-related complications than Tox−/PCR+ patients and
Tox−/PCR−patients(10[7.6%]of131vs0[0%]of162vs3[0.3%]
of 1123,P< .001). In contrast, the rate of CDI-related complica-
tions was similar between Tox−/PCR+ patients and Tox−/PCR−
patients(0%vs0.3%,P> .99).TheTox+/PCR+patientsalsohad
more CDI-related deaths than Tox−/PCR+ patients and Tox−/
PCR−patients(11[8.4%]of131vs1[0.6%]of162vs0[0%]of1123,
P< .001) while the rate was similar between Tox−/PCR+ pa-
tientsandTox−/PCR−patients(0.6%vs0%,P= .13).Twodeaths
intheTox+/PCR+groupweredirectlyattributabletoCDI,and9
had CDI as a contributing factor. One Tox−/PCR+ patient (pa-
tient 1641 in eTable 3 in theSupplement) had an uncompli-
cated, recurrent CDI that resolved before care was withdrawn
forsevereunderlyingillness,butCDIwasconsideredacontrib-
uting factor to death.
RepeatC difficileTesting and Treatment Within 14 Days
RepeatC difficiletesting and treatment within 14 days of day 1
was analyzed as an indication of ongoing clinical suspicion or
empiricaltreatmentforCDIinTox−/PCR+patients(Table3).Dur-
ing this period, 61 Tox−/PCR+ patients (37.7%) were retested,
and 13 (8.0%) had toxins detected (mean time to positive re-
sult, 5.7 days; 95% CI, 3.2-8.2 days). None of these patients de-
veloped aC difficile–related complication.However, one pa-
tient (patient 1641 in eTable 3 in theSupplement) had CDI that
was considered a contributing factor to death, although symp-
toms had resolved before care was withdrawn for other rea-
sons.Duringthesameperiod,mostTox−/PCR+patients(59.3%

Clostridium difficileTesting and Treatment
Between 15 and 30 Days
Clostridiumdifficiletestsandtreatment15to30daysafterday

Additional Analyses to Evaluate the Robustness
of the Study Findings
Outcome differences between the Tox−/PCR+ and Tox+/PCR+
groups remained significant when comparisons were limited
tothesubgroupofTox−/PCR+patientswhoreceivedfullorpar-
tial treatment within 14 days (P= .04 for time to resolution of
diarrhea andP= .004 for CDI-related complication or death)

If the historical cell cytotoxin assay had been used for di-
agnosis instead of a toxin immunoassay, 48 additional Tox−/
PCR+ patients (29.6%) would have been reported positive.
However, this subgroup had a low toxin concentration (me-

PCR+ patients (P= .47 for time to resolution of diarrhea and

Discussion
This study addresses an important question for physicians,
hospitals, and policy makers: do toxin-negative patients with
a positiveC difficilePCR test result require treatment? To
answer this question, we prospectively tested 1416 hospital-
ized patients with FDA-approved PCR tests while maintain-
ing our existing toxin test for clinical diagnosis to determine
the natural history of toxin-negative patients with positive
PCR results. We found that 55.3% (162 of 293) of patients
with a positiveC difficilePCR test result lacked toxin by the
clinical toxin immunoassay test and had outcomes that were
comparable to patients with noC difficiledetected. These
Tox−/PCR+ patients had milder symptoms at the time of test-
ing and a shorter duration of diarrhea than toxin-positive
patients. In total, 58.7% (95 of 162) were never retested, and
only 13.0% (21 of 162) received the equivalent of a full course
of treatment. Repeat analyses with the treated Tox−/PCR+
patients removed did not change our conclusions. Overall, 18
of 19C difficile–related complications and deaths (94.7%)
occurred in toxin-positive patients. Only one of 162 toxin-
negative patients (0.6%) was considered to have CDI as a con-
tributing factor to death.
Ourfindingsareconsistentwiththeconventionalviewthat
CDIisatoxin-mediatedinflammatorydiseaseprecededbyan-
tibiotic exposure andC difficileovergrowth.3Toxin-negative
patients had less antibiotic exposure,C difficileDNA, and in-
flammationandmanifestedmildersymptomsandnocompli-
cations, despite minimal or no treatment. These findings
stronglysuggestthatmostpatientswithnegativetoxintestre-
sultsandCdifficiledetectedbyPCRdonotneedtreatmentfor
CDI.Wesuspectthatmostofthesepatientswerecolonizedwith
C difficileand had another cause of diarrhea. This hypothesis
is supported by studies22-26,31showing thatC difficilecoloni-
zationandimmunityarecommoninhospitalizedpatientsand
most nosocomial diarrhea is noninfectious. It is possible that
some toxin-negative patients have mild or early infection be-
cause clinical toxin tests can miss toxin at low concentra-
tions, and occasional toxin-negative patients become posi-
tive on repeat testing.3,10,18,32-35Correspondingly, we
detected toxin in 29.6% (48 of 162) of Tox−/PCR+ patients by
the historical cell cytotoxin assay, and 8.0% (13 of 162) of

Tox−/PCR+ patients retested positive by the clinical toxin
immunoassay in a subsequent sample.However, the relative
lack of adverse events in this subgroup suggests that these
patients are also at lower risk of complications than clinical
toxin immunoassay–positive patients and routine treatment
is unnecessary.
These results are consistent with a large retrospective
study36that found noC difficile–related complications and
lower mortality among hospitalized patients with negative
toxin results. Our findings also agree with several smaller
studies11,14,37-41and one large, multicenter study21that re-
ported milder symptoms or a lower mortality rate in toxin-
negativepatientswithpositivePCRresults.Otherstudies42-45
thathaveinvestigatedclinicalcharacteristicsofTox−/PCR+pa-
tients were generally underpowered or not designed to com-
pare outcomes. Finally, there are reports of patients with se-
vereorcomplicatedCDImissedbytoxintests,43,46butourdata
suggest that such patients are rare.
Strengths of our study include the prospective study de-
sign,largesamplesize,nonreportingofPCRresults,measure-
ment of duration of diarrhea, inclusion of patients withoutC
difficileforcomparison,andrigorousevaluationofCdifficile–
related complications and deaths. We quantified fecalC diffi-
cileDNA,toxins,andinflammationtoprovidemechanisticin-
sight into the reasons for the different test results and
outcomes. The primary weakness of the study was the inabil-
itytoachieveequivalentriskallocationbetweengroups.Inad-
dition, we cannot exclude the possibility that empirical treat-
mentaffectedoutcomesinsomeTox−/PCR+patients,butthe
outcome differences we observed remained when these pa-
tients were removed. It is also possible that our outcome ad-
judicators were influenced by positive toxin results, but 26 of
42 Tox+/PCR+ patients with ICU care or death (61.9%) were
judged not to have a CDI-related outcome, indicating that the
adjudication was a highly discriminatory process overall. Fi-
nally, we cannot exclude the possibility that systematic un-
derrecording of stools in patients with negative toxin results
couldaccountfortheshorterdurationofdiarrheainthesepa-
tients. However, our requirement of 2 or more days without
diarrheatoendanepisodewouldmakeitunlikelythatunder-
recording by individual nurses would have a significant ef-
fect on our diarrhea measure.
Molecular tests have the potential benefits of decreasing
the need for repeat testing and empirical treatment because

of their high negative predictive value and may have a role
in infection prevention if Tox−/PCR+ patients contribute to
the spread ofC difficilein health care facilities.34,43,47How-
ever, our results offer compelling evidence that as many as
half of the patients with positiveC difficilePCR test results
are likely to be overdiagnosed and exposed to unnecessary
treatment at institutions using molecular tests. The number
of patients potentially affected by this issue is massive.
Most institutions experience a 50% to 100% increase in
reported CDI after switching to molecular tests, and the pro-
portion of institutions using molecularC difficiletests has
increased dramatically since initiation in 2009 of the first
FDA-approved molecular test.11-15In 2014, almost 44% of
NHSN acute care facilities reported using molecular tests for
CDI diagnosis (NHSN, written communication, September
15, 2014).
Therefore, there is an urgent need to educate physicians
that molecular tests are not specific for CDI, even in the pres-
ence of symptoms, and patients with positive PCR results do
not necessarily need treatment. Similarly, while underdiag-
nosis may occur with lack of testing,48policy makers should
be aware that molecularC difficiletests are a major cause of
overdiagnosis and consider the potential costs of overtreat-
mentinrecommendationsandanalyses.Laboratoriesneedto
be aware that rejection of formed stool samples is not suffi-
cienttoensurethatallpositivemolecularCdifficileresultsrep-
resent disease.
We concur with authors in the United Kingdom that mo-
leculartestsshouldnotbeusedasastand-alonediagnostictest
for CDI and diagnostic recommendations should move back in
the direction of defining clinical disease as a positive toxin re-
sult in patients with diarrhea.21,49Most toxin-negative pa-
tients withC difficiledo not need specific treatment, although
there may be a role for identifying carriers to prevent
transmission.21,43Futurestudiesshouldfocusondevelopingdi-
agnosticapproachestoaccuratelydistinguishpatientswithac-
tive infection vs colonization, which may include quantitation
ofC difficileDNA, toxins, or host response. In the meantime,
2-step testing with a screening test, such as PCR or glutamate
dehydrogenase antigen detection, followed by a toxin test to
confirmactiveinfectionisareasonablediagnosticstrategy.21,49
Conclusions
Uptohalfofthepatientswithpositivemoleculartestresultsfor
C difficiledo not experience adverse events without treatment
and do not need treatment for CDI. Exclusive reliance on mo-
lecular tests forC difficilediagnosis is likely to result in overdi-
agnosis,unnecessarytreatment,andincreasedhealthcarecosts.

Diagnosis ofClostridium difficileInfection
Treat the Patient, Not the Test
Erik R. Dubberke, MD, MSPH; Carey-Ann D. Burnham, PhD
No laboratory testcan diagnoseClostridium difficileinfec-
tion (CDI). Rather, CDI is a clinical diagnosis that can be sup-
ported by laboratory data. While a diagnostic assay may
indicate the absence or presence of the organism or its tox-
ins, the test by itself does not determine who does or does
not have CDI.
One of the challenges in diagnosing CDI is that there are
more asymptomaticC difficilecarriers than there are people
with CDI in the community and in the hospital. It is estimated
3%to7%ofthehealthyadult
populationarecolonizedwith
C difficile.1Asymptomatic
colonization is more common among individuals with inpa-
tient health care exposures. Between 4.4% and 15% of people
arecolonizedwithCdifficileonadmissiontothehospital,with
as many as 50% of persons living in long-term care facilities
colonized.1Toaddtothedilemma,diarrheaisfrequentamong
those with health care exposures. AlthoughC difficileis the
most common health care–associated pathogen in the United
States and CDI is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, it
typicallyaffectslessthan1%ofhospitalizedpatientsandisthe
causeofdiarrheainonly5%to10%ofhospitalizedpeoplewho
have diarrhea and are tested forC difficile.1
In the absence of clinical data, it is impossible to deter-
mineifapositiveCdifficilediagnosticassayrepresentsasymp-
tomaticC difficilecolonization or CDI. To date, few high-
quality studies have determined the true performance of
C difficilediagnostic assays when the clinical picture is taken
into account. This dilemma is why knowledge of the clinical
context of the patient is so important when evaluatingC dif-
ficileassays,asillustratedbyPolageetal2inthisissueofJAMA
Internal Medicine.
Polage et al2demonstrate that patients who wereC diffi-
cilenegative by toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) but posi-
tivebypolymerasechainreaction(PCR)(Tox−/PCR+)hadsig-
nificantlylessseverediarrheaatthetimeoftesting,morerapid
resolutionofdiarrhea,andfewerCDI-relatedcomplicationsor
deaths(P< .001forall)comparedwithpatientswhowereposi-
tive by toxin EIA and PCR (Tox+/PCR+). The presentation and
outcomes of patients with specimens that were Tox−/PCR+
were no different from those of patients with specimens that
werenegativebybothtoxinEIAandPCR.Thestrengthsofthis
study are its large sample size, the inclusion of high-quality
data about patients before and after the testing episode, the
longitudinalfollow-upofpatientsafterdischargefromthehos-
pital, and the fact that the results of the PCR-based diagnos-
tic assay were not reported to clinicians and so could not in-
fluence their treatment decisions.
The findings by Polage et al2are consistent with what is
known about CDI, toxin EIAs, and PCR-based diagnostics for
C difficile. Fecal samples positive for toxin have higher bacte-
rial and toxin levels in stool and higher levels of inflamma-
tory markers than stool samples positive by PCR alone, indi-
catingthatthosepositivebyPCRalonearemorelikelytohave
asymptomaticC difficilecarriage than CDI. The largestC dif-
ficilediagnosticcomparisontodatereportedtestresultsfrom
6522inpatientepisodesandfoundthatpeoplepositivefortoxin
were more likely to die compared with people colonized with
Cdifficilebutwithoutdetectabletoxininstool.3Plancheetal3
alsoobservedthatmortalityamongindividualswhowerecolo-
nized withC difficilebut without detectable toxin was no dif-
ferent from that among individuals who were not colonized
withC difficile.
Another important observation by Polage et al,2which is
consistent with prior literature, is that more of their patients
were Tox−/PCR+ than Tox+/PCR+. The real-world perfor-
mance of PCR when clinical data were taken into account in
this study yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of
87.4%, for a positive predictive value of 44.7%. In a much
smaller study4in which our group prospectively interviewed
and examined all patients who had stool samples included in
aC difficileassay comparison, it was found that the specific-
ityofPCR-baseddiagnosticsrangedfrom84.3%to86.1%when
theclinicalpresentationofpatientswasconsidered,withacor-
responding positive predictive value of 44.0% to 47.1%. With
such low positive predictive values, it is not surprising that
there are numerous false positives with PCR testing. Indeed,
theCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention5foundthatthe
CDIincidenceincreasedby43%to67%athospitalsthatchange
from toxin EIAs to PCR-based assays for detection.
The increase inC difficiledetection associated with PCR-
baseddiagnosticshasseriousimplicationsatthehospitaland
patient levels. More positive assays result in more patients in
contact precautions. Such precautions are costly in that they
require resources such as single rooms and gowning.Clos-
