What makes a section header

 Different font family, size or face (bold, italic) than text before or after it.
 Short phrase  (exclude text in parenthesis)
 Text on a line followed by a list (bulleted or enumerated)
     getNodeSet(doc, "//p[ not(contains(., '•')) and contains(following-sibling::p, '•')]")
 Maybe further to the left than the text preceding/following it.


(Some) Bullets are &bull; in Tika's world. How do we query those in XPath.


Tika breaks some sentences into several paragraphs.
But pdfMiner breaks each line into its own node, and even physically separate parts of a line
into separate nodes.
  e.g. Mulhearn's publications are on different lines in pdfminer's tree, but in tika's HTML 
    they are mostly in one <p>  (but not #3


In pdfMiner's output, the text can be broken up into different <textbox> nodes that are out of sequence.
We have to look at the location to put them back together again.
  See Mulhearn , publication #9 in PDF
  But in the Tika HTML, we get 




Strategy

Find running header/footer information and remove it

Find any lines that have an "underline" right below them.

Remove the <page> nodes

Find the nodes that identify a section and mark those nodes with an attribute, or put all the nodes
  between these section nodes within a <section>

 To identify a section title, we have various different approaches.
  A problem is to know which order to pursue them and evaluate the results.

  a)  Title indented to the left of the following text, i.e. the following text has more indentation.
        getSectionsByIndent()

  b)  Underline directly below a line
        1)  all the way to the other side of the page
        2)  or to the end of the text and there is no other text on that line.

        findUnderlines()

  c)  Text with following text on new lines has list item identifiers: numbers, bullets.


  d)  Text that starts in a font that is not used as much as others in the text.
       Probably bold, or a larger size

       getFonts(doc, TRUE)  gives us the number of characters in each font
       The font for the section titles should yield a reasonably small count.
       We can then look at the text for the less commonly used fonts and also
       check that the section titles start at the left margin.

       ff = getSectionsByFont(kim)
       mh = pdfMinerDoc("SampleCVs/Mulhearn_CV.pdf")
       ff = getSectionsByFont(mh)


       [Done] Make this take into account the size.  Although if the font name has the size, use that.

docs = lapply(list.files("SampleCVs", pattern = "_miner.xml", full = TRUE), pdfMinerDoc)
names(docs) = sapply(docs, docName)
       

Also, section titles tend to be on a line by themselves, start at the left margin, and do not span the entire width of the page.

   findShortLines() finds short lines and checks there is nothing else on that "line"/vertical position. (Similarly, findUnderlines() does this calculation also.)

--------

To find the headers and footers, we can use
getHeaderByPosition, getFooterByPosition
or
getHeaderByText

    lapply(getNodeSet(pamir, "//page"), getHeaderByPosition)

The ByPosition functions use a threshold to specify the margin and that text above/below this is considered
a header/footer.

getHeaderByText() examines the first element of a <page> and then sees if it is repeated across page.
If it is, then this is a header and this defines the position considered a header/footer.
In that case, we can remove other content as extreme as this.

We can extend getFooterByPosition() to examine the pattern of the text it finds.

cv_amir - the first two sections   (Current Position and Professional Licensure) have the content not indented so we miss these

The two lines
Service, Committee & Panel Assignments
National and International
are at the same level of indentation, so we don't pick up the first one as the top-level section header.

The same thing happens with Publications and Journal Publications
 But this is okay for our purposes

We could handle this situation by looking back at the preceeding  nodes and recognizing that there
is no content between them.
